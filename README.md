# Consultation Platform
The project aims to create a consultation platform where its users can visualize information about their transportation services. This informations consists of basic data, such as their service routes, fares and times, and more complex data, obtained from a data analysis algorithm.

The directory used for this github project serves as a public version of my master's thesis, and therefore only hosts the final public version of the thesis report.

## About
This project was made as part of my internship in "Card4B - Systems S.A" and as part of my thesis in a Master of Computer Sciences at "Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa (FCUL)".
